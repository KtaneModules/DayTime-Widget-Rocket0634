    can find out!


    Date of Manufacture: This widget will include a month and a year. The year can
    represent manufacture date or "current date", if desired.

    Expected Keys: ["manufacture"] - int ["year"], string ["month"]


    Day of the Week: This widget will include a day of the week, and two numbers that
    represent a month and day.

    Expected Keys: ["day"] - string ["day"], string ["daycolor"], int ["date"], int
    ["month"], bool ["colorenabled"]


    The month featured on both widgets may not always match.


    One other widget is provided in place for when the other two are not available:

    Randomized Time: a standard widget that simply shows a static time for each widget
    present.

    Expected Keys: ["time"] - string ["time"] (four digits, may start with zero),
    bool ["am"], bool ["pm"]


    Also includes Starting Time, for use in Zen Mode.


    This mod is designed for league usage in mind, but may be used in whatever situation
    seems necessary.'
